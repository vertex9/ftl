# Fuchsia Template Library

A library containing basic C++ building blocks, such as logging and
reference counting.

This library builds for both host (this includes Linux, Windows, and
macOS) as well as target (i.e., Fuchsia) platforms and is not source
or binary stable. When building for host platforms, we currently build
with C++11, which means this library needs to build with C++11.
