# Fuchsia Template Library

A library containing basic C++ building blocks, such as logging and
reference counting.

This library builds for both host (this includes Linux, Windows, and
macOS) as well as target (i.e., Fuchsia) platforms and is not source
or binary stable. On both host and target, we build with C++14.
